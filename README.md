# JS30

> Repetition is the mother of learning. The more I code the better I get at it. Repeating concepts helps me better rememeber them.

My goal is to get super comfortable with syntax and concepts. Why? Cause when I have to do something I want to know what options I have. This is why I choose to do another JS tutorial.

I will follow [JavaScript30 by Wes Bos](https://javascript30.com/). It's won't involve any frameworks, compilers, boilerplate, and libraries.

Vamoooos ðŸ’ƒ
